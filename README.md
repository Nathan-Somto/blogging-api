# Blogging API üåê‚úçÔ∏è

This project was done to learn the basics of **NestJS** as well as the basics of writing raw SQL code. However, I've realized that raw SQL is not for me, and I will be sticking to ORMs to avoid mistakes!

## Project Setup üõ†Ô∏è

Make sure you have **PostgreSQL** installed before proceeding with the installation.

1. Install PostgreSQL from [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
2. Ensure the PostgreSQL service is running.
3. Create Tables in Database Schema
   Run the following command to set up the database:

```bash
$ cd database &&  psql -U <username> -f database.sql
```

replace **<** **username** **>** with your actual postgres username 
4. Add your user credentials

```ts
export const PASSWORD =  '<Password>';
export const DATABASE = '<Database>';
```
replace with relevant details and paste inside in 
**./src/db/db.constants.ts**

5. Install dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

6. Run the Project


```bash
# Watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# Production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

7. Run Tests(optionally)

```bash
# Unit tests
$ npm run test
```

**Note:** This is very simple project and i will be moving on to more complex stuff just done to learn the fundamentals.
